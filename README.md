JSNET Token and Secure Vault System
Welcome to the JSNET Token and Vault System, a robust implementation of an ERC20 token and an accompanying Vault contract. This project provides a simple yet powerful solution for creating and managing your own token economy with deposit and withdrawal mechanisms, allowing users to participate in a shared token pool.

Overview
JSNET ERC20 Token
The ERC20 contract in this project implements the JSNET token, named "Joel subnet setup" with the symbol "JSNET." This token adheres to the ERC20 standard, making it compatible with any Ethereum-based platform. The contract includes fundamental features like transferring tokens between users, approving third-party spenders, and managing token minting and burning.

Key Features:
Token Transfer: Easily transfer JSNET tokens between accounts.
Allowance Mechanism: Authorize third parties to transfer tokens on your behalf.
Minting & Burning: Manage the total token supply by minting new tokens or burning existing ones.
Secure Vault Contract
The Vault contract acts as a secure storage for JSNET tokens, allowing users to deposit their tokens into the Vault in exchange for shares. These shares represent the user's proportional ownership in the Vault. The Vault dynamically adjusts share distribution based on the total balance, ensuring fair and transparent management of user deposits and withdrawals.

Key Features:
Deposit & Share Minting: Deposit JSNET tokens and receive shares that reflect your ownership stake in the Vault.
Withdrawal & Share Burning: Redeem your shares to withdraw the equivalent value in JSNET tokens.
Proportional Ownership: The Vault uses a formula to calculate shares during deposits and withdrawals, ensuring fairness for all participants.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To interact with these contracts, you'll need:

Solidity ^0.8.17
An Ethereum development environment such as Remix IDE, Truffle, or Hardhat.
Deployment
Deploy the ERC20 Token:

solidity
Copy code
ERC20 jsnetToken = new ERC20();
Deploy the Vault Contract:

solidity
Copy code
Vault vault = new Vault(address(jsnetToken));
Interact with the Contracts:

Mint Tokens:
solidity
Copy code
jsnetToken.mint(1000);
Transfer Tokens:
solidity
Copy code
jsnetToken.transfer(recipient, 100);
Deposit Tokens into Vault:
solidity
Copy code
vault.deposit(100);
Withdraw Tokens from Vault:
solidity
Copy code
vault.withdraw(50);
Use Cases
The JSNET Token and Vault system is designed for a variety of applications:

Tokenized Economies: Create and manage your own token-based economy.
Shared Investment Pools: Pool tokens together for collective investment opportunities.
Secure Storage: Provide users with a secure and transparent way to store and manage their tokens.
Security Considerations
Audits: Ensure to conduct a thorough audit before deploying these contracts to a live environment.
Access Control: Implement access controls for critical functions like minting and burning to prevent misuse.
